# GodfishBot
This is a multi-purpose Telegram bot written in Java.  
It uses multiple web APIs to pull in various kinds of data.

## How to set up
1. Install the maven dependencies in your preferred way (i use NetBeans).
2. Copy the "config.example.json" file inside the "conf" folder to another file called 
"config.json"
3. Add your API token(s) to the file you just created. The Telegram Bot Token is required, the 
others are all optional.
4. Compile and run the project in your preferred way (i use NetBeans again).
